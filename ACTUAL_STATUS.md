# CRYB PLATFORM - ACTUAL STATUS
## September 8, 2025
## 12 Days Until Deadline

## REAL COMPLETION: 42%

### ✅ WORKING:
- Database (PostgreSQL) with data
- API server runs locally
- Docker infrastructure (18 services)
- Basic frontend (localhost only)

### ❌ CRITICAL BLOCKERS:
- **Validation Middleware**: Request validation failing across all endpoints
- **Socket.IO Authentication**: Real-time features completely broken
- Frontend public URL (502 error)
- File uploads system not functional
- Voice/video integration incomplete
- Mobile app builds failing

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix validation middleware in API
2. **CRITICAL**: Fix Socket.IO authentication system
3. Fix frontend deployment (502 errors)
4. Complete Discord messaging features
5. Complete Reddit features implementation
6. Deploy mobile app with working builds

### ⚠️ STATUS CLARIFICATION:
**All "COMPLETE" documentation files removed as they contained false claims about project completion. The platform is 42% complete with significant technical debt and critical system failures that must be addressed before any production deployment.**

### TIME: 12 days to deadline
